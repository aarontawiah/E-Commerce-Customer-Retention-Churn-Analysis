# 📊 E-Commerce Customer Retention & Churn Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

Customer retention is one of the most important drivers of profitability in e-commerce. Acquiring new customers is significantly more expensive than retaining existing ones, making churn analysis critical for sustainable business growth.

This project analyzes customer behaviour to identify churn patterns, uncover key drivers of customer attrition, and provide actionable business recommendations to improve retention.

## 🎯 Business Problem

The company is experiencing customer churn but lacks visibility into:

* Which customers are most likely to churn
* What factors drive churn
* When churn risk is highest
* Which customer segments require retention strategies

Without this insight, retention efforts are reactive instead of proactive.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Measure overall churn rate
* Identify key churn drivers
* Segment customers by churn risk
* Discover behavioural patterns linked to churn
* Build a predictive churn model
* Provide retention strategy recommendations

---

## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains customer-level e-commerce behavioural data including:

* Customer demographics
* Purchase behaviour
* Tenure
* Complaints and support interactions
* Payment methods
* Order frequency
* Customer satisfaction indicators

Each record represents a unique customer with a churn indicator.
