# E-Commerce-Customer-Retention-Churn-Analysis

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying key drivers of customer churn for an e-commerce platform with 50,000 customers. 
By integrating MySQL for data engineering and Power BI for AI-driven visualization, 
I developed a predictive tool that identifies high-risk segments and provides actionable business recommendations.
